			<h1>"The best way to experience culture is through its food"</h1>
			<p>This popular saying bears much truth, not just in travels. Growing up in Singapore means growing up with a hodgepodge of different cultures from people of different races, different nationalities, different languages even, but all had a common interest: Good Food. This also means that the food we have crossed many lines till its true origins become blurred, debated through the region as each try to lay claim to its ingenuity.</p>
			<p>Asian food is never as simple as slapping on a steak – often it requires a long list of ingredients with no precise measurements, tediously complicated list of steps, a long time to prepare and much patience to see it through. Yet when visiting someone’s home, it is commonplace to have them feed you. This is true of any holiday season, family gathering, or just causal hangout with friends. Not just with fruit platters or sweet treats, but full meals that everyone can gather around and share family-dining style.</p>

			<p>That’s how it feels when you go to a different country and eat where the locals eat, explore the streets for lesser known gems, and discover new foods that you never thought you would like. When you sit down for a meal in any country, it doesn’t matter what language barrier you have anymore. </p>
			<p>If you like to be more hands-on in your dining experience, cooking classes meant to introduce local dishes to tourists are the best way to dive right in! This is especially good if you are particular about the food you eat, as you can learn first-hand about the ingredients it comprises of, and tailor it to your palate. Learning to cook a dish from a different country is also a great souvenir for yourself as well, as you can then prepare the dish at home to share with friends and family and reminisce about your adventures!</p>
			<p>Enjoying a good meal with a smile, that’s the international sign for you’re happy where you are.</p>
